# Ten-Tec-507-Patriot
Ten-Tec-507-Patriot is alive ...

I bought a Ten-Tec-507-Patriot 40/20m SSB/CW Transceiver in 2016

Design is based on open source hardware and software

It's sitting there on the shelf; still new and unused

Time to put it to good use with the help of digital modes

Ionosphere; the RF frontier

These are the voyages of Ten-Tec Patriot ...
